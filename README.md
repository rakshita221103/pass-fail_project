# PASS/FAIL PREDICTION (LINEAR REGRESSION)
### The pass/fail prediction project uses machine learning to predict that anyone pass/fail based on Self_Study_Daily	and Tutorials_Monthly. It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.
## Dataset Columns:
### The Pass/Fail dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of 1000 samples with 3 features.
### a) Self_Study_Daily
### b) Tutorials_Monthly
### c) Pass_Or_Fail 
## Linear Regression:
### The pass-fail prediction project that, by means of linear regression, should return the probability of passing (1) or failing (0) based on the amount of daily self-study and monthly tutorial attendance. Here, the Pass_Or_Fail column can actually or logically represent a binary outcome variable to be predicted by the regression model.
