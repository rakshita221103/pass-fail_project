# PASS/FAIL PREDICTION (LINEAR REGRESSION)
The pass/fail predication project uses machine learning to predict if a student will pass or fail based on daily hours of self-study and monthly tutorial. It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.
# Dataset Columns:
## a) Self_Study_Daily
## b) Tutorials_Monthly
## c) Pass_Or_Fail
# Linear Regression:
One of the most popular statistical methods for understanding the relationship between the two variables is a process called linear regression, which enables the fitting of a straight line to the data points. It is basically used for the prediction of one variable from another based on the assumption of linearity in the relationship between variables. This technique finds wide application in various fields of trend analysis, making forecasts, and learning correlations between factors.
